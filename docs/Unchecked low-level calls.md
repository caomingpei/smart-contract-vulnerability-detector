# Unchecked low-level calls

## 基本情况
* Check: unchecked-lowlevel
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: Medium

## 描述
The return value of a low-level call is not checked.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract MyConc{
    function my_func(address payable dst) public payable{
        dst.call.value(msg.value)("");
    }
}
```
The return value of the low-level call is not checked, so if the call fails, the Ether will be locked in the contract. If the low level is used to prevent blocking operations, consider logging failed calls.

## 推荐方式
Ensure that the return value of a low-level call is checked or logged.
