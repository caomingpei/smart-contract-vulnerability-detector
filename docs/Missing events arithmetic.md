# Missing events arithmetic

## 基本情况
* Check: events-maths
* Severity: Low
* Confidence: Medium

## 描述
Detect missing events for critical arithmetic parameters.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract C {

    modifier onlyOwner {
        if (msg.sender != owner) throw;
        _;
    }

    function setBuyPrice(uint256 newBuyPrice) onlyOwner public {
        buyPrice = newBuyPrice;
    }

    function buy() external {
     ... // buyPrice is used to determine the number of tokens purchased
    }    
}
```
updateOwner() has no event, so it is difficult to track off-chain changes in the buy price.

## 推荐方式
Emit an event for critical parameter changes.
