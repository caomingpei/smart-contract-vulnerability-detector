# Constant functions using assembly code

## 基本情况
* Check: constant-function-asm
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: Medium

## 描述
Functions declared as constant/pure/view using assembly code.

constant/pure/view was not enforced prior to Solidity 0.5. Starting from Solidity 0.5, a call to a constant/pure/view function uses the STATICCALL opcode, which reverts in case of state modification.

As a result, a call to an incorrectly labeled function may trap a contract compiled with Solidity 0.5.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract Constant{
    uint counter;
    function get() public view returns(uint){
       counter = counter +1;
       return counter
    }
}
```

Constant was deployed with Solidity 0.4.25. Bob writes a smart contract that interacts with Constant in Solidity 0.5.0. All the calls to get revert, breaking Bob's smart contract execution.

## 推荐方式
Ensure the attributes of contracts compiled prior to Solidity 0.5.0 are correct.
