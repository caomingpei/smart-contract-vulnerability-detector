# Divide before multiply

## 基本情况
* Check: divide-before-multiply
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: Medium

## 描述
Solidity integer division might truncate. As a result, performing multiplication before division can sometimes avoid loss of precision.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract A {
	function f(uint n) public {
        coins = (oldSupply / n) * interest;
    }
}
```
If n is greater than oldSupply, coins will be zero. For example, with oldSupply = 5; n = 10, interest = 2, coins will be zero.
If (oldSupply * interest / n) was used, coins would have been 1.
In general, it's usually a good idea to re-arrange arithmetic to perform multiplication before division, unless the limit of a smaller type makes this dangerous.

## 推荐方式
Consider ordering multiplication before division.
