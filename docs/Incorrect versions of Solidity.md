# Incorrect versions of Solidity

## 基本情况
* Check: solc-version
* Severity: Informational
* Confidence: High

## 描述
solc frequently releases new compiler versions. Using an old version prevents access to new Solidity security checks. We also recommend avoiding complex pragma statement.

## 推荐方式
Deploy with any of the following Solidity versions:

0.5.16 - 0.5.17
0.6.11 - 0.6.12
0.7.5 - 0.7.6 Use a simple pragma version that allows any of these versions. Consider using the latest version of Solidity for testing.
