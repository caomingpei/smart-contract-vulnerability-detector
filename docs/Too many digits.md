# Too many digits

## 基本情况
* Check: too-many-digits
* Severity: Informational
* Confidence: Medium

## 描述
Literals with many digits are difficult to read and review.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract MyContract{
    uint 1_ether = 10000000000000000000; 
}
```
While 1_ether looks like 1 ether, it is 10 ether. As a result, it's likely to be used incorrectly.

## 推荐方式
Use:

Ether suffix,
Time suffix, or
The scientific notation
