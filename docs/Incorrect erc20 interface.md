# Incorrect erc20 interface

## 基本情况
* Check: erc20-interface
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: High

## 描述
Incorrect return values for ERC20 functions. A contract compiled with Solidity > 0.4.22 interacting with these functions will fail to execute them, as the return value is missing.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract Token{
    function transfer(address to, uint value) external;
    //...
}
```

Token.transfer does not return a boolean. Bob deploys the token. Alice creates a contract that interacts with it but assumes a correct ERC20 interface implementation. Alice's contract is unable to interact with Bob's contract.

## 推荐方式

Set the appropriate return values and types for the defined ERC20 functions
