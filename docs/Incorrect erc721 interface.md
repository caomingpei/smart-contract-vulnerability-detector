# Incorrect erc721 interface

## 基本情况
* Check: erc721-interface
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: High

## 描述
Incorrect return values for ERC721 functions. A contract compiled with solidity > 0.4.22 interacting with these functions will fail to execute them, as the return value is missing.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract Token{
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (bool);
    //...
}
```

Token.ownerOf does not return an address like ERC721 expects. Bob deploys the token. Alice creates a contract that interacts with it but assumes a correct ERC721 interface implementation. Alice's contract is unable to interact with Bob's contract.

## 推荐方式

Set the appropriate return values and vtypes for the defined ERC721 functions.
