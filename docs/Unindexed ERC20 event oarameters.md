# Unindexed ERC20 event oarameters

## 基本情况
* Check: erc20-indexed
* Severity: Informational
* Confidence: High

## 描述
Detects whether events defined by the ERC20 specification that should have some parameters as indexed are missing the indexed keyword.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract ERC20Bad {
    // ...
    event Transfer(address from, address to, uint value);
    event Approval(address owner, address spender, uint value);

    // ...
}
```
Transfer and Approval events should have the 'indexed' keyword on their two first parameters, as defined by the ERC20 specification. Failure to include these keywords will exclude the parameter data in the transaction/block's bloom filter, so external tooling searching for these parameters may overlook them and fail to index logs from this token contract.

## 推荐方式
Add the indexed keyword to event parameters that should include it, according to the ERC20 specification.
