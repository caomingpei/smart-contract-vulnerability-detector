# Uninitialized local variables

## 基本情况
* Check: uninitialized-local
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: Medium

## 描述
Uninitialized local variables.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract Uninitialized is Owner{
    function withdraw() payable public onlyOwner{
        address to;
        to.transfer(this.balance)
    }
}
```
Bob calls transfer. As a result, all Ether is sent to the address 0x0 and is lost.

## 推荐方式
Initialize all the variables. If a variable is meant to be initialized to zero, explicitly set it to zero to improve code readability.
