# Dangerous strict equalities

## 基本情况
* Check: incorrect-equality
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: High

## 描述
Use of strict equalities that can be easily manipulated by an attacker.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract Crowdsale{
    function fund_reached() public returns(bool){
        return this.balance == 100 ether;
    }
```

Crowdsale relies on fund_reached to know when to stop the sale of tokens. Crowdsale reaches 100 Ether. Bob sends 0.1 Ether. As a result, fund_reached is always false and the crowdsale never ends.

## 推荐方式

Don't use strict equality to determine if an account has enough Ether or tokens.
