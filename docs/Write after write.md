# Write after write

## 基本情况
* Check: write-after-write
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: High

## 描述
Detects variables that are written but never read and written again.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract Buggy{
    function my_func() external initializer{
        // ...
        a = b;
        a = c;
        // ..
    }
}
```

`a` is first asigned to `b`, and then to `c`. As a result the first write does nothing.

## 推荐方式

Fix or remove the writes.
