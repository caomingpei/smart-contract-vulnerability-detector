# Reused base constructors

## 基本情况
* Check: reused-constructor
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: Medium

## 描述
Detects if the same base constructor is called with arguments from two different locations in the same inheritance hierarchy.

## 利用案例
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract A{
    uint num = 5;
    constructor(uint x) public{
        num += x;
    }
}

contract B is A{
    constructor() A(2) public { /* ... */ }
}

contract C is A {
    constructor() A(3) public { /* ... */ }
}

contract D is B, C {
    constructor() public { /* ... */ }
}

contract E is B {
    constructor() A(1) public { /* ... */ }
}
```
The constructor of A is called multiple times in D and E:

+ D inherits from B and C, both of which construct A.
+ E only inherits from B, but B and E construct A. .

## 推荐方式
Remove the duplicate constructor call.
