# Dangerous usage of tx.origin

## 基本情况
* Check: tx-origin
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: Medium

## 描述
Detects if the same base constructor is called with arguments from two different locations in the same inheritance hierarchy.

## 利用案例
```solidity
contract TxOrigin {
    address owner = msg.sender;

    function bug() {
        require(tx.origin == owner);
    }
```
Bob is the owner of TxOrigin. Bob calls Eve's contract. Eve's contract calls TxOrigin and bypasses the tx.origin protection..

## 推荐方式
Do not use tx.origin for authorization.
