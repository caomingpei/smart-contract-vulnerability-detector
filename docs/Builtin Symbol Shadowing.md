# Builtin Symbol Shadowing

## 基本情况
* Check: shadowing-builtin
* Severity: Low
* Confidence: High

## 描述
Detection of shadowing built-in symbols using local variables, state variables, functions, modifiers, or events.

## 利用案例
```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Bug {
    uint now; // Overshadows current time stamp.

    function assert(bool condition) public {
        // Overshadows built-in symbol for providing assertions.
    }

    function get_next_expiration(uint earlier_time) private returns (uint) {
        return now + 259200; // References overshadowed timestamp.
    }
}
```
now is defined as a state variable, and shadows with the built-in symbol now. The function assert overshadows the built-in assert function. Any use of either of these built-in symbols may lead to unexpected results.

## 推荐方式
Rename the local variables, state variables, functions, modifiers, and events that shadow a builtin symbol.
